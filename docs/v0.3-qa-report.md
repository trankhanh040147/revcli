- [ ] Border is visible and distinct
- [ ] Only one code block highlighted at a time
- [ ] Highlighting updates when navigating between blocks
- [ ] Highlighting persists when scrolling

### Navigation

- [ ] `]` key navigates to next code block
- [ ] Navigation wraps (from first to last, last to first)
- [ ] Viewport scrolls to show active code block
- [ ] Navigation works with multiple code blocks in review
- [ ] Navigation works with code blocks in chat responses
- [ ] Navigation works when code blocks span across review and chat

### Smart Yank
- [ ] `yb` yanks the currently highlighted code block
- [ ] Yanked content is correct (no ANSI codes, just code)
- [ ] Falls back to last code block if none highlighted
- [ ] Works for code blocks in review response
- [ ] Works for code blocks in chat responses
- [ ] Visual feedback shows "✓ Copied code block to clipboard!"

### Contextual Hints

## 3. Preset Management

### Preset List
- [x] `revcli preset list` shows all built-in presets
- [x] Presets display with descriptions
- [x] Empty custom preset directory handled gracefully
- [ ] `revcli preset list` shows all custom presets
- [ ] Built-in and custom presets are clearly separated

### Preset Create
